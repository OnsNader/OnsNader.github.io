<div id="move">
<p>Hello all! I'm an English literature student who's always wanted to learn programming. I've always viewed it as </br> an alien, abstruse and hostile field while
  simultaneously feeling jealous of people who were proficient at it.</p> <p>So, I was scared to actually attempt learning. I tried learning C and Java but I always stopped when things </br>got too hard. That went on 
until I heard about your program and I knew this was it.</p> <p> I was determined to work hard this time and to get in. I was late to join the previous cohort but I've been</br> preparing since. I've learnt so so much in just a month and it's been a turbulent journey.
</p> <p>But, I didn't stop. Not once. I really want this. I'm brimming with ideas and I want the comprehensive proficiency and understanding of coding that your academy offers and which will enable me to realize hypothetical apps, websites and ideas.   </p>
